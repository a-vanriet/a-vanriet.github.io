I am a researcher working at the interface between **quantum information**, **quantum foundations**, and **quantum computing**.

I study subjects such as causality in quantum theory, indefinite causal order, and higher-order quantum theory.
I focus on the design of conceptual and mathematical frameworks to describe, manipulate and understand these ideas.
I try to figure out what they can teach us both from a foundational and an applied perspective.

I am currently an Inria postdoc in the [Quacs group](https://www.inria.fr/en/quacs) in Saclay, France.
