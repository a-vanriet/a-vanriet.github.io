I am a researcher working at the interface between **quantum information**, **quantum foundations**, and **quantum computing**.

I study subjects such as causality in quantum theory, indefinite causal order, higher-order quantum theory, and quantum reference frames.
I focus on the design of conceptual and mathematical frameworks to describe, manipulate and understand these ideas.
I try to figure out what they can teach us both from a foundational and an applied perspective.

I am currently a "Maître de Conférences" (Assistant Professor) at Télécom Paris, within the Inria [Quriosity group](https://iqa.telecom-paris.fr/) in Saclay, France.
