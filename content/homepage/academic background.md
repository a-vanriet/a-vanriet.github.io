I studied theoretical physics at École Polytechnique and École Normale Supérieure de Lyon,
then did an MRes in quantum information at Imperial College London.

My thesis, awarded by Imperial College, was carried out at the [Quantum Group](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/quantum/)
of the University of Oxford, supervised by [Jonathan Barrett](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jonathan.barrett/) and [Giulio Chiribella](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/giulio). It focused on the development of _routed quantum circuits_, an extended formal framework to encompass quantum scenarios
that do not fit within the standard framework for quantum theory, that of quantum circuits.
